# E-Commerce Project

## Description
Created by 4 person team, this was a 4-day project as part of the Concordia Web Development bootcamp. We were given a .json file of wearable technology items (names, prices, and thumbnails), and instructions that the MVP had to allow users to browse and purchase those items, updating their stock in the backend via a RESTful server. Everything else was up to us, provided we stuck to the MERN stack and didn't use any extra libraries/dependencies.
